## Aim
The aim of this assignment is to implement a lexical and syntax analyser using JavaCC for a simple language called CCAL.

The details of the CCAL language are given [here](http://www.computing.dcu.ie/~davids/courses/CA4003/ccal.pdf).


## Submission
This is an individual assignment. You should submit, by email to David.Sinclair@computing.dcu.ie, all the source files (JavaCC file and other files which were used to generate your parser) in a Winzip file along with a declaration that this is solely your own work (except elements that are explicitly attributed to another source), a brief description of each of the major components of your lexical and syntax analyser that describes how you implemented them, by **10am on Monday 7th November 2016**.

Submissions without the declaration of that the assignment is the student's own work will not be assessed. The assignment carries 15 marks and late submissions will incur a 1.5 mark penalty for each 24 hours after the submission.
